# Goal
Solve Problems from https://projecteuler.net/  in python, R, javascript, sql (postgres) to gain better understanding of the languages. No libraries/packages allowed (except for unit testing libraries). Each function is developed using test driven development.

# Structure
Each Problem has its own folder given by the ID of the problem. Each folder contains a funcs file, a testing file and a script file.

# Funcs file
Each funcs file contains all functions needed for the problem. This means functions can repeat in different problems. For clarity we allow that.

# Testing file
For each function we first think of tests to validate the output of the function. Only after we have defined tests, we start the coding of them. Each function has tests associated with it as we use Test Driven Development.

# Script file
Each script file solves the given problem when executed and returns the answer as a printed value.
