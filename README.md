# Goal
Solve Problems from https://projecteuler.net/  in python, R, javascript, sql (postgres) to gain better understanding of the languages. No libraries/packages allowed. Each function is developed using unittests.

# Structure
Each Problem has its own folder given by the ID of the problem. Each folder contains a funcs file, a testing file and a script file.

# Funcs file
Each funcs file contains all functions needed for the problem. This means functions can repeat in different problems. For clarity we allow that.

# Testing file
Each function has tests associated with it as we use Test Driven Development.

# Script file
Each script file solves the problem when executed and returns the answer as a printed value.
