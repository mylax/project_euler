# Goal
Solve Problems from https://projecteuler.net/  in python, R, javascript, sql (postgres) to gain better understanding of the languages. No libraries/packages allowed (except for unit testing libraries). Each function should be developed using test driven development.

# Structure
Each Problem has its own folder given by the ID of the problem. Each Problem has a folder for every language the problem was solved in.

# Python
Using python 3 and unittest package.

# Javascript
Using node.js for running the scripts and mocha, chai for testing.

# SQL
Using postres.

# R
Using unittest library.

# Funcs file
Each funcs file contains all functions needed for the problem. This means functions can repeat in different problems. For clarity I allow that.

# Testing file
For each function I first think of tests to validate the output of the function. Only after I have defined tests, I start the coding. Each function has tests associated with it as I want to get into the habit of Test Driven Development.

# Script file
Each script file solves the given problem when executed.
